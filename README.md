# i18n-tool
A project origins from a django internationalization demand, which needed to translate several chinese infomation hard-coded in the python code. However, I still want to give it a try to build a wheel to make this process more convenient and universal for other programming languages, or for unregulated projects which are too corpulent to redesign.
